# git-learning
### `git init` Git begining tracking changes made to the project.
### Three parts of a Git project:
  1. Working Directory. Where you'll be doing all the work.
  2. Staging Area. Where you'll list changes you make to the working directory.
  3. Repository. Where Git permanently stores those changes. 
### `git status`: checks the status of your changes 
### `git add file`: add a file to the staging area.
### `git diff filename`: check the differences between the working directory and the stage area. 
### A *commit* is a last step in a Git workflow. `git commit -m "Here is going message"`
